ARMOR
PCs who wear armor receive a positive modifier 
to their Endure Injury roll. NPCs who wear armor 
subtract their armor rating from the amount of Harm
they take each time it applies.

Dog
A dog can take 1–3 Wounds (depending on the size of the dog). An attacking dog can  attack.
Attacks:
◊ Knock over [1] [Distance: arm, no small dogs].
◊ Bite [1–2] [Distance: arm, the dog can lock jaws and not let go]. 

Teargas spray

Lockpicks
The PC can open a locked door. Depending on circumstances, the PC may be Acting Under Pressure.

Crowbar
The PC can open a locked door but will be making 
a lot of noise in the process. Depending on circumstances, the PC may be Acting Under Pressure. Crowbars can be used as crushing hand-to-hand weapons.

Stun gun (taser)
Stun guns of the self-defense kind might require the attacker to physically touch her victim, while those used by law enforcement can eject electrodes up to a few meters distance. The latter kind requires recharging before repeat use.
◊ Shock [1] [Distance: arm/room, NPC target is neutralized, PC target Endures Injury and is knocked out on a (–9)].

Silencer
A silencer is a gun attachment, which muffles the noise of firing the weapon. The noise doesn’t disappear entirely and the effect is highly dependent on the weapon’s type and caliber. As a general rule of thumb, the noise is only detectable in the immediate surroundings (room).

Flashbang
A flashbang is an explosive used to daze people in the vicinity by emitting a blinding flash of light accompanied by a loud bang. It causes no bodily harm.
◊ Detonation [–] [Distance: room/field, hits multiple targets, NPCs are momentarily neutralized, PCs may Avoid Harm and are momentarily 
neutralized on a (–9)].

◊ Knockout [–] [Distance: arm/room, NPC target is momentarily neutralized, PC target Endures Injury and is knocked out on a (–9)].

Torch
